This program was not used to correct the spelling of our file since it would have taken us days to run the code. Which is time we did not have access to.

When running this program the files S1.txt, S2.txt, S3.txt, S4.txt, and S5.txt all have to be within the same directory as this file to extract the content. Also the files Spell_Checked_S1.txt, Spell_Checked_S2.txt, Spell_Checked_S3.txt, Spell_Checked_S4.txt, Spell_Checked_S5.txt also have to be in the same directory as that is where the spell corrected text will be placed for each file.
